      C: so, do you have anything you want to say to me? <br>
      Maggie: Yeah, I'm sorry that I treated you like crap, can we still be friends? <br>
      C: Why did you act like you hated me? <br>
      Maggie: Because my loser ex boyfriend didn't like you and forced me to think that way. I am so sorry! <br>
      C: I miss hanging out with you. <br>

    <p>Me: Good evening this is genevieve speaking<br>
        Dad: Hi gen, it s your dad<br>
        Me: Dad- I was thinking of you lately trying to remember some of the things we did together, the conversations we had.<br>
        Dad: Remember when we played basketball during that summer vacation?<br>
        At that beach-where was that beach?<br>
        Me: I can t recall.<br>
        Dad:Hmmm me neither.<br>
        Me: But I remember your pea soup. And the time you stopped me in the hallway and told me the answer to the riddle- <br>so I would look smart when you asked everyone else. I only have a few other clear memories the others-<br> I m not sure if they re real memories or just images from old photographs.<br>
        Dad: It s ok. I think you're a very smart girl, and you re doing so well. I wish I could be with you.<br>
        Me: I really miss you- still.<br>
        Dad: I know. Don t worry so much about the little things; everything will come together in the end.<br>
        Me: Ok, I love you.<br>
        Dad: I love you so much. Bye.</p>

        <p>Me: Hello?<br>
Mama: Hello, Buzzy?<br>
Me: Yeah, Mama, it's me.<br>
Mama: You're voice has changed so much. You're my big nine-year-old girl now, huh?<br>
Me: Yeah, nine years, seven months and (pause) sixteen days. I'm almost ten.<br>
Mama: Did you get the card I sent you? Sorry I couldn't send you something, but I'm still looking for a job.<br>
Me: Yeah, I got the card. Butterflies are my favorite.<br>
Mama: I almost got you one with a rabbit pulling a man out of a hat.<br>
Me: Silence<br>
Mama: You know I love you?<br>
Me: Yeah.<br>
Mama: You know I miss you?<br>
Me: Then why don't you come home?<br>
Mama: You know I'm trying to get better. I've been dry for almost seven months.<br>
Me: Why don't you come back here and finish drying out?<br>
Mama: It's hard to come back when you've been gone for so long. Gets harder every day. <br>Sometimes I think you're all better off without me. I made you miserable when I was there.<br>
Me: We're more miserable without you.<br>
Mama: Really? Are you, honey? Because I'm miserable, too. Minnesota's a horrible place. I'm going to <br>pack my bags this very second and head right back to California. I promise to never have another drink <br>as long as I live and I promise to live well into my seventies. Sound like a deal?<br>
Me: It's a deal!

            2--hello, kae, this is ---.<br>
            1--oh, hi ---.. how are you?..<br>
            2--look, i'm glad we talked earlier. obviously, you'd had <br>some things on your mind that you needed to share with me--<br>
            1--yes..<br>
            2--and i needed to hear it, boy, did i ever.. i'd never <br>realized before what a basketcase i've been.. girls, when they broke up with me,<br> would just do it fast--so abruptly--often through email--and <br>usually they'd just say that they'd started getting serious with <br>someone else and wanted to settle down and that was that. <br>i wonder now if they hadn't been telling me the whole story..<br>
            1--oh, really?..<br>
            2--yeah, because now that you've pointed it out, <br>i can see that my possesive behaviour, my jealousy, <br>my anger, my secrecy--all these things--i can see that <br>they've been patterns in my relationships for a long time now..<br>
            1--really.. wow..<br>
            2--yeah, i know.. crazy, isn't it? and unfortunate, that no one else cared <br>enough to try to help me help myself by pointing out how i drive people away. <br>no wonder i'm 41 and alone..<br>
            1--oh, ---, don't say that..<br>
            2--no--it's true, its absolutely true. and i just want to thank <br>you--that's why i called you back--(sorry about saying "fuck you"<br> before on the phone and asking for my curious george hat back--sorry about that--you <br>can actually keep it--i said some things i didn't mean in the heat of the moment, <br>there)--but no, really--i want to THANK you. our time together has been really special.<br>
            1--for me, too--really, i--<br>
            2--thank you, kae, for all you've given me. i think you're a great girl.<br> and a great lay. and did i mention, superfine?<br>
            1--aw, ---..<br>
            2--well, toots, i'll miss ya. take care of yourself. i know you'll find someone else to love you in no time flat.<br> as for me, wish me well, will ya? don't forget me? and all the fun we've had?<br>
            1--no, never, ---..<br>
            2--i'm gonna hang up the phone before i have to hear you say goodbye, okay? ready? three, two one--<br>

Tom: Hi. Um. ...Is this Georgia?<br>
  
Me: Yeah.<br>
  
Tom: This is Tom. Um. ...I know I haven't talked to you since...I don't know when it was...whenever it was I talked to you last.<br> I just thought it was about time I look you up-see what you're up to. How are you?<br>
  
Me: (stunned) Good. Good! ... How are you?<br>
  
Tom: Hey, do you still have the snakes?<br>
  
Me: Oh. Yeah. Well, Lemony died last winter, I'm so sad about it, but I still have Proteus. How about you? <br>Where are you? I haven't talked to you in so long. This is so weird...<br>
  
Tom: I know. Sorry I never responded to that email you sent when I accidentally sent you that mass mail. <br>I just...this last year has been so weird...I..I wouldn't have known what to say.<br>
  
Me: Well, it's good to hear from you now. How are you?<br>
  
Tom: Um...well....I'm Mormon now.<br>
  
Me: Are you kidding me?<br>
  
Tom: Seriously, I'm Mormon now. ...Yeah, I know.<br>

        Me: Hi<br>
  
Him: Hi<br>
  
Me: I was so afraid to hear your voice. I'm trembling.<br>
  
Him: Why?<br>
  
Me: I wasn't ready I guess. It was like when we first met in person. I was scared. I almost didn't want to.<br>
  
Him: You didn't want to?<br>
  
Me: Not really. I wanted to up until the moment before. I realized then that I didn't really have feelings as strong as I had thought.<br> I'm too young to have to stay with the same person forever.<br>
  
Him: Oh... Well, if there's love, then...<br>
  
Me: No, you don't understand. You say if the feelings are strong then the relationship can make it through anything. <br>There aren't strong feelings anymore.<br>
  
Him:...<br>
  
Me: I stayed with you for five years because I was scared of my own feelings.<br>
  
Him: ...<br>
  
Me: And I hope you understand and don't take it personally now that we're apart.<br>
  
Him: How can I not?<br>
  
Me: You're a wonderful person. You take care of everyone. I can only hope to be that selfless when I grow up... eventually.<br>
  
Him: You are grown up.<br>
  
Me: I made you think that. But I'm not. I'm a stupid kid.<br> Now, I need to get to the real reason why I needed to talk to you.<br>
  
Him: Ok...<br>
  
Me: The last time we spoke I wasn't able to express this. I didn't know how to put it in words.<br>
  
Him: ...<br>
  
Me: For five years I've had doubts about my feelings for you. I realize now that I've been in love with the idea of you. <br>I've been chasing a fantasy. But you're a person. A human being. And I'm not ready for that yet. <br>I loved how you made me feel when I was alone. I'll always love the idealized version of you. <br>But I don't love you. I never really did.<br>
  
Him: How is that possible?<br>
  
Me: Never underestimate the power of denial. Remember that line? From American Beauty?<br>
  
Him: Yes.<br>
  
Me: Anyway, I wanted to get my true feelings out. Not just the sugarcoated version that I expressed to you last week. <br>And now that you know that there will never again be an "us," we can both move on. <br>It's hard to believe that we went from what we were to what we are now, isn't it?<br>
  
Him: I'll still wait for you. I still love you with all my heart.<br>
  
Me: I'm sorry you're wasting your love on me.<br>
  
Him: I'm not wasting my love.<br>
  
Me: Well, I'll never love you back. I don't think I'm ready to be friends. <br>So... Goodbye.
